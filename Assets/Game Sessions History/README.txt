Since I was not entirely clear on what data exactly was supposed to be stored, I decided to go with a descriptive sequence of all events in each game session.
Each game session is stored on its own JSON file, and it includes the session #, Players specific movements, and result (row win, column win, tie). 

I decided to go with a more descriptive way since I feel it would help to have an easier on understanding of each game session.
I hope this can fullfill the requirements.
